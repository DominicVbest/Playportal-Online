    <td width="50%" align="center">Snake is a classic video game that originated in the late 1970s and became popular in the 1990s. The objective of the game is to control a snake, which moves around a screen, eating food and growing in length. The player must navigate the snake through obstacles without crashing into walls or the snake's own tail. The game typically begins with a small snake on the screen, and as it eats food, its length increases, making it more challenging to move around. The game continues until the snake crashes into a wall or its own tail, at which point the game ends.</td>
